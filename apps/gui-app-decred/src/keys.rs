// This is the single most security-sensitive file in the app and the exact
// analogue of gui-app-bitcoin/src/store.rs::load_master_key. The Bitcoin app
// hands the secure element's entropy to BDK's `MasterKey::from_entropy`. BDK
// is Bitcoin-only, so we cannot. Instead we hand the same entropy to
// decred-core (the KeyOS adapter over the shared dcr-rs library), which
// performs BIP39 -> BIP32 (Decred dprv version bytes) -> account/address
// derivation using the *same* audited secp256k1 + HMAC-SHA512 primitives,
// differing from Bitcoin only where Decred actually differs (version bytes,
// BLAKE-256, sighash, tx serialization).
//
// Trust note to carry into review: because BDK can't help here, this app sees
// raw BIP39 entropy. That is a strictly larger trust surface than the Bitcoin
// app's constrained BDK path. The mitigations: derivation/signing happen
// in-process behind the OS user-confirmation gate, the entropy is never
// persisted, dcr-rs zeroizes the 64-byte seed and every derived ExtPrivKey on
// drop, and everything that does NOT need private material (review, receive
// addresses, watch-only export, wrong-wallet detection) runs from a cached
// account-level *public* key instead of re-touching the seed.
